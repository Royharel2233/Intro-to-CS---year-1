/**
 *  Computes some statistics about families in which the parents decide 
 *  to have children until they have at least one child of each gender.
 *  The program expects to get one command-line argument: an int value
 * 	that determines how many families to simulate.

	(Almost final version, no points) Now write a program ( OneOfEachStats1.java ) that takes an
	integer command-line argument, say T. In each of T independent experiments, simulate a couple
	having children until they have at least one boy and one girl. Use the results of the T experiments
	to compute the average number of children that couples who follow this strategy end up having.
	In addition, compute how many couples had 2, 3, and 4 or more children. Finally, compute the
	most common number (also known in statistics as mode) of children in a family (if there is a tie,
	print only the first most common number of children). As before, assume that the probability of
	having a boy or a girl in each trial is 1/2. Here are some examples of the program's execution
	(your program will most likely generate other results, because of the randomness):

	Use a for loop for running the T simulations. In each iteration, execute the
	same logic as that of the OneOfEach program (copy-paste the code of OneOfEach into the code of
	OneOfEachStats ). Although itâ€™s not required, we suggest keeping (at least some of) the print
	statements of OneOfEach , for debugging purposes. When you think that the OneOfEachStats
	program behaves well, you can eliminate, or comment out, these print statements.

	As T increases, we expect the average number of children per family to
	converge to a stable average. Run the program with T = 3, 10, 100, 100000 and 1000000, to
	watch how the average converges to a stable value.
