 *  Simulates the formation of a family in which the parents decide 
 *  to have children until they have at least one child of each gender.

	(Basic version of the next program, no points) Some couples have a strong sense of balance:
	They keep having children until they have at least one boy and at least one girl. Write a program
	( OneOfEach.java ) that simulates this behavior. Assume there is an equal probability (0.5) of
	having either a boy or a girl in each birth. Here are some examples of the program's execution:

	The logic of this program is similar to that of the Perefect program. Think
	about how you want to terminate the loop â€“ there are several ways to do it.
	Play with (execute) the program about 20-30 times, and get a feeling about the statistical results
	of this family building strategy. Note that each run simulates how a family a formed.
